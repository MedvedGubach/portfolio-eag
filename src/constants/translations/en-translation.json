    "text": "I'm a full-stack web developer with over 3 years of experience building efficient, user-focused applications. I earned my degree in Computer Science Engineering from CUTonalá, where—despite starting out interested in hardware—I quickly found my passion in software development. That shift opened the door to what I enjoy most: solving problems, designing smart solutions, and bringing ideas to life through code. I thrive in collaborative environments and take pride in delivering high-quality, scalable solutions using modern tools like React, Node.js, and SQL. My versatility has allowed me to work across the full stack, from crafting intuitive front-end interfaces to building robust backend systems.Beyond tech, I’m into video games 🎮, metal music 🤘 (I also play electric guitar 🎸), and reading. I'm always learning—often through platforms like Udemy—to stay current with the latest in web development."
