        "text": "I am a dedicated and versatile full stack developer with a passion for creating efficient and easy-to-use web applications. I studied Computer Science Engineering at CUTonal√° and graduated with a bachelor's degree. With 3 years of professional experience, I have worked with a variety of web development technologies. My journey in web development began in an unusual way by becoming interested in computer hardware, which led me to study my aforementioned degree. When I entered the program I was surprised that it was not about anything related to hardware, at that time I had no idea about programming so it took me a little while to integrate the new knowledge. What made me passionate about programming is the ability to create solutions to a problem from scratch, especially the design and development of applications. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high-quality solutions. In addition to programming, I am a gamer üñ•Ô∏èüéÆ, a foodie, I play the electric guitar üé∏, I read books and I am a metalhead ü§ò and I usually take courses on Udemy either to keep up with new technologies or polish my knowledge."
